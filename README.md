<h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website shows what I can do at this point.The more I learn, the better it
  <br>
   will look over time. Having a visual representation of some of my skills I've found 
  <br>
  to be positive. In my portfolio I worked on my HTML and CSS skills. A small bit of 
  <br>
  JavaScript was all that was really needed to make it look the way it does. If you'd like 
  <br>
