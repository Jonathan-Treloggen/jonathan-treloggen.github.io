<h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;This website shows what I can do at this
  <br>
  point.The more I learn, the better it will look 
  <br>
  over time. Having a visual  representation 
  <br>
  of some of my skills I've found to be positive.
  <br>
  In my portfolio I worked on my HTML and CSS 
  <br>
  skills. A small bit of JavaScript was all that 
  <br>
  was really needed to make it look the way it does.
