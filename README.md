<h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>

This website shows what I can do at this point. The more I 
<br>
learn, the better it will look over time. Having a visual  
representation of some of my skills I've found to be positive.
<br>
In my portfolio I worked on my HTML and CSS skills. A small bit
<br>
of JavaScript was all that was really needed to make it look 
<br>
the way it does. If you'd like to see how it looks Click on <a href="https://jonathan-treloggen.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">Jon's portfolio</a>

<h3>Thank you for stopping bye.</h3>
